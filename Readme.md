## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

### Quick Setup Using `setup.sh`

To streamline the setup process, we provide a `setup.sh` script that automates all installation steps. Follow these instructions to get started:

### Prerequisites

Before running the `setup.sh` script, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Python 3.11+
- Conda (recommended)
- Basic build tools (`git`, `make`, `cmake`, etc.)

### Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GZWSAMA/OnePoseviaGen.git
   cd OnePoseviaGen
   ```

2. **Make the `setup.sh` script executable:**

   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ```

3. **Run the `setup.sh` script:**

   It is recommended to run this script within a fresh conda environment. Here's how you can create and activate a new environment before running the script:

   ```bash
   conda create -n OnePoseviaGen python=3.11 -y
   conda activate OnePoseviaGen
   ./setup.sh
   ```

   The script will handle:
   - Installing PyTorch with CUDA support.
   - Installing required dependencies.
   - Cloning and installing external extensions.
   - Building FoundationPose.
   - Installing local packages in editable mode.
   - Downloading pretrained weights.
   - Patching the transformers library.

4. **Verify the setup:**

   After running the script, verify that all dependencies are correctly installed and the necessary files are downloaded.

5. **Web demo:**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
